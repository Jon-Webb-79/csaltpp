CSalt++
*******
The `csalt++` project is a modern C++ library designed to support flexible, 
efficient, and safe numerical computing with matrices and vectors. It builds 
upon the ideas developed in the original C version of CSalt, enhancing them with 
templates, operator overloading, and runtime format adaptation.

This library targets performance-critical applications such as scientific 
simulations, engineering solvers, and adaptive mesh computations where matrix 
structure can vary dramatically.

Why CSalt++?

C++ offers many improvements over C, but working with numerical data still 
involves challenges:
